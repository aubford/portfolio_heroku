I have a proven track record of being fervent and resolute in my pursuit of mastery of the things I am passionate about.  When I was six, it was violin.  In high school it was theater.  During my twenties I dedicated myself to my music project that brought the production studio to the stage.  One of my bandmates enlightened me to the fascinating world of web development and it was love at first sight.  I enrolled in Galvanize's Full Stack Immersive program in Denver, CO to pursue a career as a software developer.
My skill set revolves around the Mean + P(ostgres) stack and Android Development/Java.  I am constantly striving to improve my abilities through involvement in the Denver tech community and personal projects.  My current projects include the creation of a music production app for Android and a website for Human Rights Defenders in Myanmar in collaboration with my brother who is a democracy advocate there.  I am currently seeking employment that will catalyze my growth as a software developer.
